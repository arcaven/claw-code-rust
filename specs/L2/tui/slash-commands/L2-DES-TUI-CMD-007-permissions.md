# L2-DES-TUI-CMD-007 — Slash Command: /permissions

## Purpose

Define the TUI behavior for `/permissions`, which lets the user choose what the program is allowed to do in the current session.

## Source Requirements

- `L1-REQ-TUI-006` requires discoverable commands for product workflows.
- `L1-REQ-APP-003` requires permission modes, sandboxing, explicit approval for actions outside the current permission boundary, and user-visible approval outcomes.
- `L1-REQ-TOOL-001` requires tool safety, approval, redaction, and bounded output.
- `L2-DES-APP-003` defines approval request/response protocol behavior and session metadata updates.
- `L2-DES-TOOL-001` defines the tool permission policy, sandbox boundary, and approval gates.

## Command Contract

- Command: `/permissions`
- Description: `choose what Devo is allowed to do`
- Parameters: none in the first milestone.
- Mutability: session permission metadata and possibly durable configuration, depending on persistence choice.
- Active-turn availability: allowed only for future work; it must not retroactively authorize already-running tool calls.

## UI Flow

`/permissions` opens a selection popup.

```text
┃ /permissions

> ● default
    auto-approved
    full access
```

Rules:

- The current permission mode is marked with `●`.
- The row focused by Up and Down navigation is marked with `>`.
- If the focused row is also the current permission mode, both markers are shown.
- The popup must summarize the operational effect of each mode.
- Enter applies the focused row; Esc cancels.
- If a tool approval is currently pending, the TUI must distinguish changing the default permission mode from answering that specific approval.

## State And Error Behavior

- Permission changes should be recorded as session metadata changes.
- Permission changes must be submitted to the server as canonical state changes. The TUI displays and requests changes; it does not become the authority for permission or approval decisions.
- The change applies to later tool decisions, not to already-issued provider or tool requests.
- If a mode is blocked by policy, the TUI should show why and keep the existing mode.

## Approval Boundary

`/permissions` changes the session's future permission posture. It is not the same operation as approving a pending tool action.

Rules:

- If a specific approval prompt is pending, the user must answer that prompt through the approval UI, not by changing `/permissions`.
- A permission mode change must not retroactively authorize a tool call that already requested approval.
- A scoped approval response must not be displayed as if it changed the session's default permission mode.
- If permission state is ambiguous or the server rejects the requested mode, the TUI must keep the previous mode visible and show the server-provided reason.

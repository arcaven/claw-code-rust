# L2-DES-TUI-CMD-001 — Slash Command: /theme

## Purpose

Define the TUI behavior for `/theme`, which lets the user switch the terminal UI theme without leaving the current session.

## Command Contract

- Command: `/theme`
- Description: `switch the UI theme`
- Parameters: none in the first milestone.
- Mutability: client configuration only.
- Active-turn availability: allowed during active work because it does not change agent execution.

## UI Flow

`/theme` opens a compact searchable popup using the same popup behavior as slash-command discovery.

```text
┃ /theme

> ● devo-dark
    devo-light
    terminal-default
```

Rules:

- The current theme is marked with `●`.
- The row focused by Up and Down navigation is marked with `>`.
- If the focused row is also the current theme, both markers are shown.
- Enter applies the focused row; Esc cancels.
- Theme preview may apply optimistically while the popup is open.
- If canceled, the TUI restores the previous theme.
- The selected theme should be persisted after confirmation.

## State And Error Behavior

- The command must not create a transcript turn.
- The command must not modify session metadata that affects model behavior.
- If persistence fails, the TUI may keep the theme for the current process but must show a concise warning that it was not saved.

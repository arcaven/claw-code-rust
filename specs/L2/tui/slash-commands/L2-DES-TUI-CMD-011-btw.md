# L2-DES-TUI-CMD-011 — Slash Command: /btw

## Purpose

Define the TUI behavior for `/btw`, which starts a side conversation inside an ephemeral fork.

## Command Contract

- Command: `/btw`
- Description: `start a side conversation in an ephemeral fork`
- Parameter: free-form text after the command token.
- Mutability: ephemeral runtime state only.
- Active-turn availability: allowed when a session has enough current context to fork.

## UI Flow

Inline command rendering shows the command token in primary color and the parameter hint in muted color.

```text
┃ /btw <your side conversation message>

  Build · deepseek-v4-pro high  ↑0[cached 0 0%]  ↓0  ▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱  0%  0/950k
```

Submission example:

```text
┃ /btw what if we solve this with a smaller parser-only change?

⠋ Working · 18s
  side      ephemeral fork running
```

## State And Error Behavior

- The command starts a side conversation using an ephemeral fork of the current session context.
- The side conversation must not write session, turn, item, queue, steer, or fork records to durable storage.
- The side conversation must not mutate the current session transcript, active turn, active context, or persistent configuration.
- The side conversation may use the current visible context as input, but any messages and model responses inside the side conversation are runtime-only.
- Closing or completing the side conversation discards its transcript unless a later explicit command promotes or copies content back into the durable session.
- The TUI must visually distinguish the side conversation from the durable transcript so the user understands it is temporary.
- If the current session context cannot be forked safely, the command should fail with a concise explanation rather than becoming a normal message.

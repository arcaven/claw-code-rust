# L2-DES-TUI-CMD-006 — Slash Command: /status

## Purpose

Define the TUI behavior for `/status`, which displays current session configuration, token usage, context pressure, and runtime state.

## Command Contract

- Command: `/status`
- Description: `show current session configuration and token usage`
- Parameters: none in the first milestone.
- Mutability: read-only.
- Active-turn availability: allowed during active work.

## UI Flow

`/status` opens a compact status panel or inserts a bounded status cell.

```text
┃ Status
  model       deepseek-v4-pro
  reasoning   high
  workspace   ~/Desktop/devo
  mode        Build
  tokens      ↑420[cached 300 71%] ↓12
  context     ▰▰▱▱▱▱▱▱▱▱ 20% 190k/950k
```

Rules:

- The display must use the same token/cache/context style as the bottom status line.
- Provider credentials must be represented by safe status only, never plaintext secret values.
- Active work should be shown concisely if a turn is running.

## State And Error Behavior

- The command should use server-confirmed session snapshots, usage events, and safe configuration projections.
- Missing or estimated values must be marked instead of invented.
- `/status` must not create a model-visible transcript turn.

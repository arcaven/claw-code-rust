# L2-DES-TUI-CMD-008 — Slash Command: /clear

## Purpose

Define the TUI behavior for `/clear`, which clears the current TUI transcript view without deleting durable session history.

## Command Contract

- Command: `/clear`
- Description: `clear the current transcript`
- Parameters: none in the first milestone.
- Mutability: local TUI view state only.
- Active-turn availability: allowed, but active live work remains visible after the clear.

## UI Flow

`/clear` clears completed visible transcript cells from the current TUI viewport.

```text
┃ /clear
```

Rules:

- The command must not delete session JSONL records.
- The command must not create a new session; `/new` handles new chats.
- Active turn content, pending approvals, questions, working indicators, and composer state remain visible.
- Resuming or reloading the session may restore durable transcript content unless a later requirement defines a persistent view-clear marker.

## State And Error Behavior

- `/clear` is display-only in the first milestone.
- If there is nothing to clear, the TUI may show no-op feedback.
- The command must not affect active context, compaction, model behavior, or transcript replay.

# L2-DES-TUI-CMD-012 — Slash Command: /exit

## Purpose

Define the TUI behavior for `/exit`, which exits the TUI while preserving terminal safety and server-owned session durability.

## Command Contract

- Command: `/exit`
- Description: `exit Devo`
- Parameters: none in the first milestone.
- Mutability: TUI process lifecycle only, unless the user also chooses an active-work policy.
- Active-turn availability: allowed, but must clearly handle active work.

## UI Flow

If no active turn exists, `/exit` starts terminal cleanup immediately.

If active work exists, the TUI must present a concise choice before exit.

```text
┃ /exit

  Active work is still running.
  [Keep Running And Exit] [Interrupt And Exit] [Cancel]
```

## State And Error Behavior

- `/exit` must use the terminal lifecycle cleanup path defined by `L2-DES-TUI-005`.
- The TUI must restore terminal modes and leave shell prompt placement to the shell.
- The command must not delete the current session.
- If the server continues active work after the TUI exits, the session must remain resumable.
- If cleanup fails, the TUI should emit the terminal-safe cleanup warning defined by the lifecycle design.

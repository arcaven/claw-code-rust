# L2-DES-TUI-002 — Modern TUI Shell Layout

## Purpose

Refine the terminal user interface, transcript, state visibility, and responsive layout requirements into a concrete modern TUI shell design.

## Background / Context

The TUI is the first interactive client. It must feel like a capable terminal-native work surface, not a decorative chat page. The layout should be dense, calm, readable, and stable while the agent streams model output, runs tools, waits for approvals, and accepts user input.

This document defines the high-level visual structure and responsive behavior. Specific composer behavior, streaming cell behavior, and terminal lifecycle cleanup are refined by adjacent TUI L2 documents.

## Source Requirements

- `L1-REQ-APP-007` requires an inline-capable terminal UI with header or status area, transcript area, composer area, onboarding, command discovery, and visible active work state.
- `L1-REQ-TUI-003` requires a readable and reviewable transcript.
- `L1-REQ-TUI-004` requires visible current execution state.
- `L1-REQ-TUI-007` requires responsive layout and readability.
- `L1-REQ-CLIENT-001` requires Unicode-safe and localization-ready client display behavior.
- `L2-DES-APP-003` defines the canonical client/server events used to drive the UI.
- `L2-DES-CONV-001` defines transcript turns, items, and durable replay state.
- `L2-DES-TUI-003` defines composer and input-mode behavior.
- `L2-DES-TUI-004` defines streaming transcript and state rendering.
- `L2-DES-TUI-005` defines terminal lifecycle safety.
- `L2-DES-TUI-006` defines the full transcript alternate-screen overlay entered by `Ctrl+T`.

## Design Requirement

The TUI should be organized as a stable vertical shell with five conceptual regions:

1. Session header.
2. Transcript viewport.
3. Active work strip or working indicator.
4. Composer.
5. Bottom status line.

Inline mode and alternate-screen mode should use the same conceptual shell. Inline mode additionally preserves useful terminal scrollback above the live region where possible.

## Modern TUI Principles

- Prioritize task state, transcript content, and composer usability over decoration.
- Keep region boundaries visually clear but lightweight.
- Use stable row allocation so streaming updates do not cause avoidable layout jitter.
- Use icons or compact labels only when they improve scanning.
- Avoid nested boxed panels. Use rows, separators, indentation, and compact cells instead.
- Treat color as secondary information. Text labels must still communicate state without color.
- Prefer summary lines plus expandable or scrollable detail for long content.
- Keep the composer visible whenever the terminal is large enough for interaction.

## Standard Layout

The following sketch is normative for region order and relative priority. It is not a final choice of border glyphs, color, or exact column widths.

Required characteristics:

- The startup header provides product identity, version, current model, workspace, and reasoning effort.
- The transcript viewport owns most vertical space.
- The active work strip appears only when useful and shows transient live state such as `⠋ Working · 12s`.
- The composer remains above the bottom status line.
- The bottom status line is reserved for active mode, current model/reasoning, token usage, and context-window pressure.
- The `┃` glyph in transcript and composer regions is normally a single leading marker for the active prompt line, cell title, or first content line. User-message cells and the bottom input composer are background-band surfaces: when they contain multiple user-entered lines, each content line may repeat `┃`, while top and bottom padding rows keep the shared background without rendering the marker. Diff detail, tool output detail, and assistant wrapped text align under their content column and do not repeat the marker unless they are separate logical cells.

## Startup Header Visual Rules

The startup header should use the boxed ASCII layout from the standard sketch. It should be a first-screen identity and environment summary, not a repeating transcript cell.

Theme mapping:

- The ASCII-art product wordmark uses the theme primary foreground color.
- Header border glyphs such as `┏`, `━`, `┣`, `┃`, and `┗` use a muted grey foreground.
- Header metadata labels `Model`, `Workspace`, and `Reasoning` use muted grey.
- Header version text such as `v0.1.9` uses muted grey.
- Header metadata values, such as model slug, workspace path, and reasoning value, use normal white foreground.
- The header box should not rely on color alone; the border, labels, and values must remain readable in monochrome terminals.

The tip line below the header should use bold styling for `Tip:` and normal styling for the tip content.

```text
  Tip: Ready in /Users/username/Desktop/devo
```

In the rendered TUI, only `Tip:` is bold.

## Transcript Viewport In The Shell

The transcript viewport sits between the startup/session header and the bottom composer region. It is a scrollable list of transcript cells defined by `L2-DES-TUI-004`.

Shell-level responsibilities:

- Allocate most vertical space to the transcript viewport.
- Keep the single transcript cell marker column aligned with the composer marker column where practical.
- Preserve enough bottom space for the working indicator, composer, and status line.
- Let completed transcript cells scroll away while live composer and status regions remain fixed.
- Avoid embedding the transcript viewport inside a decorative card or nested box.

The shell owns placement and clipping. `L2-DES-TUI-004` owns the detailed rendering of user, assistant, tool, shell, working, and completed-turn cells.

Example shell composition with transcript content:

```text
┃ Add escaping support for quoted parser values.

┃ Thinking: Checking existing parser tests and the quoted branch.

┃ The tests show escaped quotes are currently treated as ordinary text.

┃ Explore
  ┗ Read  crates/parser/src/lib.rs

## Region Responsibilities

| Region | Responsibility | Must Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Header | Startup identity, version, model, workspace, and reasoning effort. | Consuming too many rows or repeating full configuration. |
| Transcript viewport | Durable user-visible conversation, tool, approval, question, and error history. | Showing unlimited raw output inline. |
| Active work strip | Current live work summary, waiting reason, running background process summary. | Becoming the only place important state appears. |
| Composer | Current editable input, popups, mode-specific input affordances. | Being pushed off-screen during streaming. |
| Bottom status line | Current mode, model/reasoning, token/cache usage, and context-window usage. | Duplicating long transcript content. |

## Responsive Rules

- The composer must remain usable at every supported terminal size.
- Long lines should wrap, fold, or truncate by display columns, not bytes.
- Folding or truncation must be visible when important content is omitted.
- Terminal resize should recompute layout from current state rather than incrementally shifting old rows.
- Optional metadata should collapse before transcript or composer content.
- Popups should be constrained to the visible terminal and should not cover the composer unless the popup is directly editing composer state.
- If the terminal is too small for meaningful interaction, the TUI should show a concise minimum-size message and preserve terminal safety.

## State Sources

The TUI shell should render from server-confirmed state whenever possible:

- Session snapshots from `session.open` or `session.subscribe`.
- Turn events from `turn.event`.
- Usage updates from `usage_updated`.
- Context pressure from `context_updated`.
- Tool and background process events from `tool_call_*` and `background_process_updated`.
- Error diagnostics from `error_reported`.

Clients may optimistically render local input, but canonical state comes from the server protocol.

# L2-DES-APP-003 — Client Server Protocol

## Purpose

Refine the client/server architecture requirement into a protocol, transport, and process-ownership design that supports TUI, desktop, IDE, and future clients sharing the same agent runtime.

## Background / Context

The program has multiple potential client surfaces. Each client needs to start or resume sessions, submit turns, observe streaming output, answer approval or question prompts, and inspect shared state.

If every client launches its own private server process over stdio, those clients cannot naturally share the same active sessions or runtime state. Shared state requires a discoverable server instance that multiple clients can connect to concurrently.

## Source Requirements

- `L1-REQ-APP-001` requires client surfaces to share server-side agent behavior.
- `L1-REQ-CONV-001` requires durable session lifecycle behavior.
- `L1-REQ-CONV-002` requires observable turn lifecycle behavior.
- `L1-REQ-CONV-003` requires explicit `steer` and `queue` handling during active turns.
- `L1-REQ-CONV-004` requires session forking from a specific turn and fork traceability.
- `L1-REQ-CONV-005` requires editing the immediately preceding eligible user-authored message without mutating durable history.
- `L1-REQ-APP-002` requires persistence and recovery behavior.
- `L1-REQ-AGENT-001` requires a complete execution workflow with visible task state.
- `L1-REQ-AGENT-002` requires interrupt, cancel, inspect, and resume behavior.
- `L1-REQ-AGENT-003` requires visible task planning with status updates.
- `L1-REQ-CHANGE-001` requires rollback and recovery behavior for file changes.
- `L1-REQ-EDIT-001` requires file edits to be reviewable and recoverable.
- `L1-REQ-GIT-001` constrains git-oriented change management.
- `L1-REQ-APP-010` requires effective configuration inspection and model/reasoning updates.
- `L1-REQ-APP-011` requires actionable error recovery and provider error detail presentation.
- `L1-REQ-APP-012` requires user-data ownership, export, deletion, and credential-safe projections.
- `L1-REQ-AGENT-005` restricts the question tool to Plan Mode.
- `L1-REQ-TOOL-001` requires tool output safety and redaction visibility.
- `L1-REQ-TOOL-002` requires baseline built-in tools, including planning, approval, questions, search, command execution, web, and delegation tools.
- `L1-REQ-MEM-001` defines persistent memory as core-maintained internal state outside the routine client-server protocol surface.
- `L2-DES-TOOL-001` defines the built-in tool system and plan tool.
- `L2-DES-CONV-001` defines durable session JSONL events and distinguishes provider, server-client, and durable event planes.

## Protocol Requirement

The program should use JSON-RPC 2.0 as the logical client/server protocol envelope.

JSON-RPC is suitable because it supports:

- Request/response calls for commands that need results.
- Notifications for one-way events.
- Transport-independent message semantics.
- Reuse over WebSocket while preserving a simple method and notification model.

The protocol should define program-specific method names and event payloads rather than exposing provider-specific SSE events directly to clients.

## Transports

The program should use JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket as the client/server transport.

The local server should bind a loopback WebSocket endpoint by default. TUI, desktop, IDE, and browser-capable clients should all connect to that endpoint as WebSocket clients.

WebSocket is the required transport because it supports concurrent local clients and also fits browser-extension and desktop-client constraints. `stdio` should not be the shared-client transport because a stdio child process is normally owned by one parent client and cannot naturally be discovered and shared by TUI, desktop, and IDE clients at the same time.

## Server Instance Ownership

The default local architecture should use a single discoverable server instance per user profile.

Conceptual startup flow:

```text
Client starts
        ↓
Read server endpoint descriptor
        ↓
Try to connect to existing server
        ↓
If unavailable, acquire startup lock
        ↓
Start detached server
        ↓
Write endpoint descriptor
        ↓
Connect and authenticate
```

The endpoint descriptor should be stored in a user-scoped runtime location and include:

- Server process identifier where available.
- WebSocket endpoint URL.
- Authentication token or credential reference.
- Server version.
- Started-at timestamp.

The descriptor must be protected by user-only filesystem permissions where the operating system supports them.

## Request Response Contract

Every client request must receive a JSON-RPC response. The response confirms whether the server accepted the command, rejected it, or completed a read-only query.

For long-running operations, the response must be immediate and must not wait for the full turn, tool call, or model invocation to finish. The response allocates canonical identifiers and sequence positions; subsequent progress is delivered through server notifications.

Successful responses should include:

- `accepted`: whether the command was accepted for execution.
- Canonical identifiers created or resolved by the server, such as `session_id`, `turn_id`, `item_id`, `subscription_id`, `approval_id`, or `question_id`.
- `latest_sequence` or `next_sequence` where ordering or catch-up matters.
- A projection or snapshot when the request is a read operation.
- A safe message or warning when the request succeeds with degraded behavior.
- An idempotency result when a repeated request uses a previously seen client-generated id.

Rejected responses should use JSON-RPC error responses with:

- `code`: stable machine-readable error code.
- `message`: concise user-facing explanation.
- `data`: structured recovery context, such as missing permission, invalid session, stale sequence, invalid model, or unavailable provider.

Request methods should return explicit success or structured error results.

## Server Notifications

Representative server-to-client JSON-RPC notification methods:

| Method | Purpose | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `server.statusChanged` | Tell clients that server availability, lifecycle state, or capabilities changed. | `server_id`, `status`, `capabilities`, `latest_sequence`, optional `message`. |
| `session.event` | Broadcast session-level changes to subscribed clients. | `sequence`, `session_id`, `event_kind`, `event_payload`, `source_client_id` where applicable. |

| `config.changed` | Tell clients that effective configuration changed and dependent displays may need refresh. | `sequence`, `changed_scopes`, `changed_keys`, `source`, `safe_summary`. |

Notifications should include sequence numbers sufficient for clients to order events and request catch-up after reconnect.

## Sequencing And Catch-Up

The server should assign a monotonic `session_sequence` for each session. Every `session.event` and `turn.event` for that session should carry this sequence.

Rules:

- Clients should pass `from_sequence` when subscribing or reconnecting.
- The server should deliver missed events after `from_sequence` when those events are still available.
- If the requested sequence is too old, unknown, or compacted away, the server should send a fresh `session_loaded` snapshot and continue from the snapshot's `latest_sequence`.
- Clients should treat events as idempotent by sequence and event identity.
- Client-generated request ids such as `client_message_id` should make retries safe after transient disconnects.
- Ordering is authoritative within a session. Cross-session global ordering is not required for normal client rendering.

## Server-Client Event Payloads

Server-client event payloads should be shaped for UI responsiveness and recovery, not for durable storage.

`item_content_update` is a live client event and may be coalesced or throttled. It is not the same as a durable JSONL storage event.

## Cross-Client Broadcast Behavior

When one client submits a user message, the server must persist the accepted user input and broadcast the resulting session and turn updates to every client subscribed to that session.

All clients, including the client that initiated the request, should receive the canonical server events. Clients may optimistically render local input, but they must reconcile that display against the server-confirmed `turn_started`, `item_started`, and later item events.

Examples:

- If the TUI submits `turn.submit`, desktop and IDE clients subscribed to the same session receive the new user item and turn state.
- If the desktop client answers an approval request, the TUI and IDE clients receive the approval state update and any resumed turn events.
- If the server streams assistant output, every subscribed client receives ordered `item_content_update` events for the same item.
- If the agent updates the plan tool, every subscribed client receives `plan_updated` for the same active plan state.
- If a turn changes files through structured mutating tools, subscribed clients may receive `turn_diff_updated` events for review display.
- If one client interrupts or resumes a turn, every subscribed client receives the canonical turn status and resume events.
- If one client edits the immediately previous message, every subscribed client receives the edit event and any superseded or replacement turn events.

## Immediate Previous Message Editing

The protocol supports editing only the immediately preceding eligible user-authored message in the current session branch.

Eligibility rules:

- The server is authoritative for identifying the current branch's immediately previous eligible message.
- `message.editPrevious` must reject stale requests when `expected_target_message_id` is not the current eligible message.
- Direct editing of older historical messages must be rejected with a structured error that points the client toward session forking.
- Accepted edits must be append-only from the protocol perspective: the server records an edit and broadcasts canonical replacement state instead of mutating earlier events in place.
- The server/core is authoritative for workspace restoration. Clients may choose an allowed `workspace_restore_policy`, but clients must not be required to apply inverse patches or mutate the workspace to make message editing correct.

Execution rules:

- If the target message belongs to a completed, failed, or interrupted latest turn, the server should attempt workspace restoration for files changed by that turn, create a replacement user item and a replacement continuation turn, then mark the original turn as superseded.
- Workspace restoration should run before the replacement turn begins unless the edit is staged for later execution.
- `workspace_restore_policy` should allow the client to request the default safe restore behavior, skip restoration, or use another explicitly supported policy. The default safe behavior preserves current file contents when divergence is detected.
- Workspace restoration should use core-owned per-turn change sets, inverse records, content snapshots, or internal checkpoints. Client-visible unified diffs may help users review changes, but they are not the authoritative restore state.
- For each file changed by the superseded turn, the server should restore the pre-turn state when the current file state still matches the expected post-turn state or another safe restore predicate.
- If a changed file has diverged after the superseded turn, the server must skip restoration for that file, preserve the current file state, and report the skip in `workspace_restore_completed`.
- File changes from structured tools such as `write` and `apply_patch` should use captured before/after state or inverse operations.
- File changes from shell commands should be restored only when a reliable turn-level checkpoint or attribution record exists.
- A git-based hidden checkpoint or ghost commit may be used internally, but the protocol must expose restoration outcome rather than git implementation details. It must not publish, stage, or rewrite user-visible git history unless the user explicitly requests that.
- If the target message is a queued message that has not started, the server may update the queue item's effective content through an edit record and preserve the original revision for audit.
- If the target message belongs to an active running turn, the server must not mutate the already-started model or tool execution. It must reject the edit or require an interruption-oriented `edit_mode`; clients may offer `steer` as the lower-friction alternative.
- If a superseded turn produced non-file tool side effects, those side effects remain visible in the superseded turn. Message editing does not imply rollback for external APIs, processes, network actions, published git operations, or other non-file effects.

Broadcast rules:

- Every accepted edit must emit `message_edit_recorded` to subscribed clients.
- If workspace restoration is attempted, subscribed clients must receive `workspace_restore_started` and `workspace_restore_completed`.
- If a completed latest turn is replaced, subscribed clients must also receive `turn_superseded` and the normal events for the replacement turn.
- Clients may optimistically show an edit draft, but they must reconcile it against the server-confirmed `message_edit_recorded` event.
- `turn_diff_updated` events may be coalesced or replaced by later diff updates. Clients should treat them as display state and should not infer restore completion from them.

## Interrupt And Resume Protocol Rules

The server is authoritative for interrupt and resume state. Clients request control actions, but they must reconcile local UI against server-confirmed `turn_status_changed`, `tool_call_updated`, `background_process_updated`, and `turn_resumed` events.

Rules:

- `turn.interrupt` must return promptly after the server accepts or rejects the request. It must not wait for every provider stream, tool call, or background process cleanup action to finish.
- Accepted interruption should move the target into stopping, interrupted, completed-before-interrupt, failed, or cleanup-pending state.
- If the target turn is already terminal, the server should return an idempotent terminal result or a structured stale-state error.
- `execution.inspect` should return enough active work state for clients to show running model invocation, running tools, pending prompts, and tracked background processes without exposing secrets.
- `backgroundProcess.stop` should only target processes started and tracked by the program.
- `turn.resume` should create a linked continuation turn rather than mutating the interrupted turn in place.
- Resume requests should be rejected or degraded with a warning when required context, workspace state, or permission state is unavailable.
- Resumed turns must use the normal execution engine and normal safety policy.

## Tool And Plan Protocol Rules

Tool calls are requested by the model and executed by the server-owned tool supervisor. Clients observe canonical tool and plan events; they do not decide whether a model-requested tool call is valid except when an approval or question response is explicitly requested.

Rules:

- Tool state should be reported through `tool_call_started`, `tool_call_updated`, and `tool_call_completed`.
- A tool unavailable due to mode, permission, or missing configuration should complete with a structured blocked or unavailable result rather than disappearing.
- Plan tool updates should be reported through `plan_updated`, not only as assistant text.
- `plan_updated` should carry the complete current plan projection or enough patch data for clients to reconstruct it from prior canonical plan state.
- The plan tool must not expose private model reasoning. Plan item text should be concise, user-visible task state.
- In Normal Mode, question-tool attempts must be rejected before `question.requested` is emitted.
- In Plan Mode, mutating tools must be blocked before execution and should produce a structured blocked result if requested.
- `multi_tool_use` child calls must still produce per-tool events and must not bypass validation, approval, or mode gates.

## Approval And Question Resolution

Approval and question requests are single-resolution prompts. Multiple clients may display the same prompt, but only the first accepted response should resolve it.

Rules:

- The server owns approval and question state.
- A successful `approval.respond` or `question.respond` resolves the prompt and broadcasts `approval_resolved` or `question_resolved`.
- If another client answers after the prompt has been resolved, the server must reject the request with a structured stale-state error such as `already_resolved`.
- `question.requested` must only be emitted when Plan Mode or another explicit requirement allows the question tool.
- In Normal Mode, the server must reject question-tool attempts before emitting `question.requested`.

## Session Deletion And Forks

Deleting a session must preserve user-visible consistency for forks.

Rules:

- `session.delete` must report fork descendants before destructive deletion when descendants exist.
- Deleting a parent session must not make surviving forked sessions unusable.
- If a fork survives parent deletion, inherited history required by that fork must remain available through a replayable inherited-history segment. That segment may be backed by protected shared records, materialized fork history, or another explicit retention mechanism.
- The parent session link in a fork is provenance and navigation metadata. It must not be the sole content pointer required to replay inherited history.
- After deletion, the parent session link may be non-dereferenceable. Clients must treat parent navigation failure as distinct from inherited-history loss.
- Before a parent session is made inaccessible, `session.delete` must either preserve the inherited segment for each surviving fork, materialize the inherited segment into the fork, or reject deletion until the user chooses another policy.
- Fork indicators should show parent deleted or unavailable when navigation to the parent can no longer work, while keeping origin metadata visible.
- Hard deletion of records still referenced by surviving forks must be blocked unless those forks first receive replayable inherited-history segments or the user explicitly requests cascade deletion of the dependent forks where supported.

Persistent memory is core-maintained internal state. Session deletion may cause core memory maintenance internally, but the client-server protocol must not expose per-memory deletion decisions, linked memory lists, or memory-management prompts.

## Provider Event Boundary

Provider/core events are internal to agent execution. They may be more granular than both server-client events and durable JSONL events.

Representative provider/core events:

- `llm_request_started`
- `reasoning_started`
- `reasoning_delta`
- `reasoning_completed`
- `assistant_response_started`

The server should normalize provider/core events into:

- Durable JSONL events for persistence.
- Server-client events for live display.
- Runtime control events for orchestration.

## Multi-Client State

The server owns sessions, turns, approvals, model invocation, tool execution, context assembly, and persistence.

Clients should not create independent server state when an existing local server is available. Multiple connected clients should subscribe to the same session and receive ordered event streams for the same underlying turns and items.

If a client disconnects, the server continues owning active work subject to user-configured lifecycle policy. A reconnecting client should resubscribe and receive either missed server-client events or a fresh projection of the current durable session state.
